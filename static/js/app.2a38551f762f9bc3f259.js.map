We are the midst of crisis. Niconico douga is at war against a far-reaching storm of disturbance and deletion. Niconico\\'s economy is badly weakened, (which is) a consequence of carelessness and irresponsibility on the part of management, but also on the collective failure to make hard choices, to prepare for a new mad age. Today, I say to you, that the challenge is real, they are serious, and they are many. They will not be easily met in a short span of time. But know that at Niconico, they will be met. In reaffirming the greatness of our site, we understand that greatness is never, and our journey has never been one of a shortcut. It has not been the path for the faint-hearted or seek only the fleshly pleasures. Rather, it has been the risk-takers, the wasted genii, and the creators of MAD thing. For us, they toiled in sweatshops, and endured the lash of the spanking, time and time again these men struggled and sacrificed so that we may live better. We remain the most powerful site on the internet and minds are no less inventive. And services no less needed than they were last week or yesterday, or the day before the day after tomorrow. Starting today, we must pull♂up♂our♂pants，dust ourselves off, and begin again the work of remaking Niconico douga. Now, there are some who question the scale of our ambitions, who suggest that our server system cannot tolerate too many movies. Their memories are short, for they have forgotten what Niconico has already done, what free man can achieve when imagination is joined to the common purpose. And so, to all the people who are watching this video, from the grandest cities to the small villages where IKZO was born, know that Niconico is a friend of every man who seeks the future of love and peace. Now, we will begin to responsibly leave the authorized common materials to Niconico people, and forge a hard-earned peace in this MAD world. What is required of us now, is a new era of responsibility. This is the price and promise of Niconico common’s citizenship. Niconico douga, in the face of our common dangers, in this winter of our hardship, let us remember these timeless words: ASS♂WE♂CAN. Let it be said by our children’s children, that when we were tested by DoS attacks, when we were refused by Youtube, we did not turn back, nor did we falter. And we carried forth that great gift of freedom delivered it safely to future generations. Thank you, god bless, god bless Niconico douga.'\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n          'user': '木吉',\r\n          'comment': '吼吼吼吼全给党。'\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n          'user': 'Van Darkholme',\r\n          'comment': 'My name is Van, I\\'m an artist, a performance artist.
